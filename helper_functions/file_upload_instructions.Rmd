# Model File Upload Guide

## Uploading mrgsolve Models

### Prerequisites
- Single C++ model file with `.cpp` extension
- Recommended file extension: `.cpp`

### Upload Workflow
1. Navigate to the "Drop or Upload Model Files" section
2. Select your mrgsolve `.cpp` model file
3. Select "mrgsolve (.cpp)" in the File Format dropdown
4. Preview the model code using "View Model Code"
5. Review the model in the Model Editor
6. Confirm upload by clicking "Save Model"

### Model File Requirements
- Valid mrgsolve C++ model file
- Complete model definition
- Compliant with mrgsolve model syntax

## NONMEM to mrgsolve Translation Package

### Package Overview
- **Name**: nonmem2mrgsolve
- **Developer**: Andy00000000000
- **Repository**: [nonmem2mrgsolve on GitHub](https://github.com/Andy00000000000/nonmem2mrgsolve)

### Package Purpose
The `nonmem2mrgsolve` package streamlines the translation of NONMEM models to mrgsolve format, addressing critical challenges in pharmacometric modeling workflows.

### Translation Capabilities
- Convert model parameters
- Translate individual and residual variability structures
- Preserve original model logic and compartment definitions
- Handle diverse NONMEM model implementations

## NONMEM Model Translation Process

### Required Files
- NONMEM control file (`.ctl` or `.mod`)
- Corresponding `.ext` file

### Translation Steps
1. Select required files:
   - NONMEM control file (`.ctl` or `.mod`)
   - Corresponding `.ext` file
2. Choose "NONMEM (.ctl/.lst)" in the File Format dropdown
3. Initiate conversion with "Convert to mrgsolve"
4. Review the translated model in the Model Editor

### Translation Considerations
- Potential limitations in perfect feature translation
- Complex custom implementations may require manual refinement
- Recommended: Verify translated model against original

## Package Installation

### R Package Installation Method
```r
# Install nonmem2mrgsolve from GitHub
devtools::install_github("Andy00000000000/nonmem2mrgsolve")
```

## Troubleshooting Translation

### Common Resolution Strategies
1. Verify complete file set (control + ext files)
2. Validate NONMEM model syntax
3. Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
4. Thoroughly review translated model accuracy
